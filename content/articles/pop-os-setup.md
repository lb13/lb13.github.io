Title: Setting up Pop!_OS
---

I recently had the misfortune of losing my SSD to old age, and so needed to replace it.

Although I backed up all my essential files, there was a lot of minor adjustments I had made to the OS that needed to be replaced once I re-installed on the new SSD.

Here's a quick summary.

## Tweaks
### Alt-tab behaviour
The default behaviour of alt-tab is to switch between applications - to switch between instances of the application, you need to use alt-` which I find too much hassle.

Fortunately, this is easy to fix using the built-in Settings app. Just go to the keyboard shortcuts and bind alt-tab to **Switch Windows**.

## Software
### Visual Studio Code
### Vivaldi Browser
### Shotwell
